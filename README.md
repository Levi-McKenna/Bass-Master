# Bass-Master

## A new and ambitious rhythm game project for new and old bass players

This was originally a project intended for a SkillsUSA competition, but after winning the state championship, *Bass-Master* has become more than that. *Bass-Master* has the potential to be the best way to learn and practice playing the bass. This idea was developed between a team of two, and it consists of a platforming like gameplay that forces players to play a real bass and input correct notes to gain higher scores.
