# Bass-Master

An alternate controller rhythm game. 

## A new and ambitious rhythm game project for new and old bass players!

> Development of this project is paused until I find the time and passion to work on this again.

This was originally a project intended for a SkillsUSA competition, but after winning the state championship, I hope that *Bass-Master* can become more than that. *Bass-Master* has the potential to be the best way to learn and practice playing the bass. This idea was developed between a team of two, and it consists of a platforming like gameplay that has players play a real bass and input correct notes to gain higher scores. For now, that's as simple as the project is. I see a lot more potential in the concept; it just needs more time in development. I would like to refactor the code first and foremost as, beyond the game engine, there are no real abstractions and the code can be hard to follow at times. *I AM NOT A GAME DEVELOPER*. Most of my education and experience/passion is working with low-level systems and programs; I hope that one day I can showcase that more on my Github profile.  It was great fun and learning the basics of playing a bass and implementing pitch detection were truly the highlights.
